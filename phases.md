# App Platform Hack Project

## Phase 1

- Statically defined app manifests
- Apps list index page
- App details page (`apps/[id]`)
- Oauth2 flow (user must manually generate Oauth2 key for app)
- Example "app" that can accept the Oauth2 redirect, exchange for tokens

## Phase 2

- UI polish
- Persistence - remember which apps are activated/installed
- Proxy `apps/[id]/options` to an external URL?
- Reverse proxy from "core"

## Not in Scope

- App hosting
- Everything else you might need in an app manifest...
- Permission scopes
- etc...
